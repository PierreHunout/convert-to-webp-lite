Automatically convert your images to WebP format for faster page loads and better performance. Save bandwidth and boost your site speed effortlessly.

== Description ==

**Convert to WebP Lite** is a powerful yet lightweight WordPress plugin that automatically converts your images to the modern WebP format, delivering up to 30-50% smaller file sizes without sacrificing quality. Give your visitors a faster, smoother browsing experience while reducing bandwidth costs and improving your SEO rankings.

WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior compression for images on the web. Converting your images to WebP means:

* **30-50% smaller file sizes** compared to JPEG and PNG
* **Faster page load times** leading to better user experience
* **Improved SEO rankings** thanks to better Core Web Vitals scores
* **Reduced bandwidth usage** and lower hosting costs
* **Universal browser support** - all modern browsers now support WebP

= Key Features =

* **Automatic Conversion** - New uploads are instantly converted to WebP  
* **Bulk Conversion Tool** - Convert your entire media library with one click  
* **Original Files Preserved** - Your original images are safely kept as backup  
* **Picture Tag Support** - Use HTML5 `<picture>` tags for automatic fallback  
* **Quality Control** - Adjust WebP quality from 0-100 (default: 85)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What image formats are supported? =

The plugin supports conversion of **JPG**, **PNG**, and **GIF** image formats to WebP. It processes all WordPress image sizes automatically (thumbnail, medium, large, full, and any custom sizes).

= Are my original images preserved? =

Yes! The plugin **never modifies or deletes** your original images. It creates WebP versions alongside the originals, ensuring you always have a backup and compatibility with older browsers.

= What happens if a browser doesn't support WebP? =

The plugin uses HTML5 `<picture>` tags (when enabled) that provide automatic fallback to the original JPEG/PNG images for browsers that don't support WebP. No JavaScript required!

= What PHP extensions are required? =

You need:
* **PHP GD extension** with WebP support

The plugin will automatically detect if GD is available with WebP support. Most modern servers have this extension installed by default.

= Can I convert existing images in my media library? =

Absolutely! Go to **Settings → Convert to WebP Lite** and click the **"Convert previously uploaded images"** button. The plugin will process all images in your media library with a real-time progress indicator.

= What quality setting should I use? =

The default quality of **85** is recommended for most websites as it provides an excellent balance between file size and image quality. You can adjust this from 0-100:
* **60-70:** Smaller files, some quality loss (good for large galleries)
* **80-90:** Balanced (recommended for most sites)
* **90-100:** Highest quality, larger files (for photography sites)

= Will this slow down my site? =

No! Conversion only happens during image upload or bulk conversion, not when pages are viewed. In fact, WebP images are 30-50% smaller than JPEG/PNG, so your site will load **faster** for visitors.

= Can I delete all WebP files if I change my mind? =

Yes. Go to **Settings → Convert to WebP Lite** and scroll to the bottom. Click **"Delete all WebP files"** to remove all WebP versions. Your original images are never touched.

= Where are WebP files stored? =

WebP files are stored in the same directory as the original images in your WordPress uploads folder, with a `.webp` extension. For example:
* Original: `/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.jpg`
* WebP: `/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.jpg.webp`

= Does this plugin use external services? =

No. All image processing happens **locally on your server**. The plugin does not send your images to any external API or service.

= What data does this plugin collect? =

**None.** The plugin does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage statistics. It respects your privacy completely.

= How do I enable debug mode? =

Go to **Settings → Convert to WebP Lite** and enable **"Debug mode"**. Logs will be stored in `/wp-content/convert-to-webp-lite-logs/` folder. This is useful for troubleshooting conversion issues.

= I'm getting conversion errors. What should I do? =

1. Enable **Debug mode** in the settings
2. Check the log files in `/wp-content/convert-to-webp-lite-logs/`
3. Verify your server has GD extension with WebP support
4. Increase PHP memory limit if needed (add `define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');` to wp-config.php)
5. Contact support with the error logs

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

Yes! We welcome contributions. Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PierreHunout/convert-to-webp-lite) to report issues, suggest features, or submit pull requests.

4. **Conversion Progress Modal** - Visual feedback during bulk operations showing current file being processed and overall progress percentage. The tool safely processes images in batches to prevent server timeouts.
